Bao Framework (C) 2017 and beyond Bao.Bao@asia.com

Released under the MIT license. See LICENSE for details

Compiling:

This project uses make, tsc (typescript command line), browserify, uglifyjs, php (cli)
It is up to you as a smart individual to get these into your build system.
Once done, just run make in the top level directory (and all should be good).

Including the framework in other projects:

I've not thought about this much, but I think if you take the Bao directoy that is
created in the "node_modules" directory and dump it in the equivalent directory of your
project - it should maybe work.

An update, the framework is now in npmjs, the binary repo for the framework is at
https://github.com/BaoFramework/bao-framework
